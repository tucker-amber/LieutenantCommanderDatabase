For our primary dataset, we chose data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
Our data pertains to generators built in the United States and is collected by Form EIA-860. 
This data contains multiple files that provide a detailed description of every electric generator 
in the U.S. Some examples of data included in this set are location, ownership, prime mover of generator, 
electricity output, emissions, costs, equipment, and so much more.

The second data set comes from Form EIA-861. It supports the primary dataset by providing a more in depth 
explanation of the economic factors associated with the generators mentioned in the primary dataset. It provides 
operation and metering data associated with costs and outputs for each generator. 


The connections between these two data sets would be that they each provide information on electricity generators 
in the United States. Using both of them, we can analyze things like cost of electricity in different sectors and at 
different levels, efficiency of output, and growth rate of certain technologies over time
