\f0\fs24 \cf0 For our primary dataset, we chose data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Our data pertains to generators built in the United States and is collected by Form EIA-860. This data contains multiple files that provide a detailed description of every electric generator in the U.S. Some examples of data included in this set are location, ownership, prime mover of generator, electricity output, emissions, costs, equipment, and so much more. \
