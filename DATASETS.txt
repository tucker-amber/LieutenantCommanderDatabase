For our primary dataset, we chose data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
Our data pertains to crops exported from the United States and is collected by the USDA. 
This dataset contains six files (each file = 1 year of data. 2000-2005) that provide a detailed description of crops exported from 
the U.S. Some examples of data included in this set are crop type, country code, country name, week exported, region code, and cost.
Irregularities are present in the "commodity code" column (some are listed as strings and some as numbers).

We have not selected a secondary dataset, but there are a number of options for exploration. A secondary dataset could be used to compare what conditions are correlated with exportation of crops, including production in the United States/abroad, annual weather patterns, warfare, etc.
